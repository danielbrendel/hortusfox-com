    <h3>🌿 HortusFox Partnership & Affiliate Programme</h3>

    <p>
        HortusFox offers an affiliate and partnership programme  — 
        an initiative designed to foster collaboration within the plant, gardening, 
        botany, ecology as well as the open-source, development, engineering and (self)hosting community.
    </p>

    <h3>🤝 Who can partner-up?</h3>

    <p>
        Anyone in the given field can contact us, however we do manually approve possible partnerships and affiliates. 
        We carefully select partners and affiliates whose values align with our mission and who can contribute meaningfully 
        to our user community or related communities. Whether you're offering 
        complementary tools, products, projects, services or educational resources, we're open to collaboration — as long as it 
        enhances the experience of all involved entities.
    </p>
    
    <h3>💡 Why are we doing this?</h3>

    <p>
        There are two outcomes of this. First of all, providing a partnership and affiliate programme can build strong
        connections between entities. We believe in a world of green technology and there is a vast of possibilities as well
        as specialities required to progress on this in future. So, why not innovate and improve the future together?
        The other reason is that running the HortusFox ecosystem requires substantial infrastructure and ongoing server maintenance. 
        The affiliate and partnership programme is one of the ways we are working to sustainably cover these costs.
    </p>
    
    <h3>🔒 Important Note on Programme Limitations</h3>

    <p>
        Being accepted into the partnership or affiliate programme does not confer any decision-making authority over HortusFox, 
        its development direction, or its community policies. Partners and affiliates do not receive special access or privileges 
        beyond the scope of the agreed collaboration.
